## Welcome to Priva!
### Priva is your new TLDR for Reading Terms of Use / Privacy Policies!

### Adding this extension to your Chrome browser will allow you to instantly recieve a summary of that website's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
###
### Upon downloading Priva, you will need to obtain an OpenAI GPT-3 API Key and paste it into the top variable or script.js
### You can obtain one here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
###
### Once that is complete, simply load it into your Chrome browser, and you'll be good to go!
### Enjoy!
